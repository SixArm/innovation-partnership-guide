# Innovation Pentathlon framework

The Innovation Pentathlon framework is a conceptual model that outlines five key dimensions or stages of the innovation process. It provides a holistic view of the various aspects that organizations need to consider and address to effectively manage innovation. The five dimensions of the Innovation Pentathlon framework are:

* Generation: This dimension focuses on generating new ideas and concepts. It involves creating an environment that fosters creativity, encouraging idea generation from both internal and external sources, and implementing processes or techniques such as brainstorming, design thinking, or open innovation to generate a pool of innovative ideas.

* Selection: The selection dimension involves evaluating and selecting the most promising ideas for further development. It includes criteria and processes for screening and assessing ideas based on their alignment with strategic goals, market potential, feasibility, and other relevant factors. Selection mechanisms may involve internal committees, expert evaluations, market analysis, or customer feedback.

* Implementation: The implementation dimension focuses on turning selected ideas into tangible products, services, or processes. It encompasses project management, prototyping, testing, and iterative development to transform ideas into viable innovations. Effective implementation requires resource allocation, cross-functional collaboration, and efficient execution of plans and processes.

* Strategy: The strategy dimension involves aligning innovation initiatives with the overall strategic goals and direction of the organization. It entails defining an innovation strategy, identifying target markets or customer segments, understanding competitive dynamics, and determining the positioning and value proposition of the innovations. Strategic considerations also include intellectual property protection, market entry strategies, and potential partnerships or alliances.

* People: The people dimension recognizes that innovation is a people-driven process. It involves fostering an innovation culture, building diverse and cross-functional teams, providing necessary training and resources, and empowering employees to contribute to the innovation process. People-centric aspects also encompass leadership support, change management, and creating an environment that encourages collaboration, risk-taking, and learning.

By considering these five dimensions, the Innovation Pentathlon framework provides a comprehensive approach to managing innovation across the entire innovation lifecycle. It emphasizes the interplay and importance of multiple factors in driving successful innovation outcomes. Organizations can use this framework to assess their innovation capabilities, identify areas for improvement, and develop strategies and processes that cover the full spectrum of innovation management.

# Innovation Pentathlon framework

The Innovation Pentathlon framework is a conceptual model that outlines five key dimensions or stages of the innovation process. It provides a holistic view of the various aspects that organizations need to consider and address to effectively manage innovation.

Organizations can use this framework to assess their innovation capabilities, identify areas for improvement, and develop strategies and processes that cover the full spectrum of innovation management.

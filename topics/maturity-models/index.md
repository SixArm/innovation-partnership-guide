# Maturity models

Maturity models are frameworks used to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of processes, systems, or organizations. The models provide benchmarks for the current state and guidance on how to improve it. The models are often used in the areas of quality management, process improvement, and IT service management.

The essential idea is that an organization can improve its capabilities by moving through a series of maturity levels. Each level represents a higher degree of capability and maturity in terms of processes, practices, tools, and resources.

**Typical levels:**

1. **Initiate:** Processes are just starting, ad hoc and unstructured, with little or no documentation or standardization.

2. **Develop:** Basic processes are in place, but they are often reactive and not well-defined. There is some documentation and standardization.

3. **Standardize:** Processes are well-defined and documented, and there is a focus on continuous improvement. Processes are also integrated across different functions and departments.

4. **Manage:** Processes are measured and analyzed using quantitative data. There is a focus on statistical process control and continuous improvement.

5 **Orchestrate:** The organization is focused on continuous improvement, innovation, and integration. Processes are adapted and optimized based on feedback and analysis.

Maturity models provide a roadmap for improvement and a framework for measuring progress. However, it's important to remember that maturity models are not a one-size-fits-all solution; each organization must adapt the model to fit its unique needs and circumstances.

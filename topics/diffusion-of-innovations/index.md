# Diffusion of innovations

The diffusion of innovations is a theory that explains how new ideas, products, or technologies spread  within a society. The theory was first introduced by Everett Rogers in 1962 and has since been widely applied in various fields, including marketing, sociology, public health, and technology adoption. The theory describes five sequential stages of adopters.

Stagesâ€¦

1. Innovators: They are typically adventurous, risk-takers, and willing to try new ideas. Innovators often have a high tolerance for uncertainty and are motivated by the potential benefits of the innovation.

2. Early Adopters: They are opinion leaders, influencers, tend to have higher social status, and are eager to try new ideas. Their adoption is a signal to others about the potential of the innovation.

3. Early Majority: The early majority are more deliberate in their decision-making, and rely on the experiences and opinions of the early adopters. They tend to want evidence of success.

4. Late Majority: They are more skeptical, and often adopt due to social pressure or necessity. They may have concerns about the innovation's risks or compatibility with existing practices.

5. Laggards: They are resistant to change and may have limited exposure or access to the innovation. Laggards often rely on traditional ways of doing things and are reluctant to embrace new ideas.

The theory also considers factors that influence the adoption process, including the characteristics of the innovation itself (relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability) and its communication channels.

# Public-Private Partnership (PPP)

Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is a collaborative arrangement between a government or public sector entity and a private sector company or consortium. In a PPP, both parties work together to develop, finance, operate, and maintain a project or deliver public services. PPPs are typically established for large-scale infrastructure projects, such as transportation systems, power plants, hospitals, or educational institutions.

**Key aspects:**

Shared Responsibilities: In a PPP, responsibilities and risks are shared between the public and private sectors. The government defines the project objectives and regulatory framework, while the private sector brings in innovation, technical expertise, financial resources, and operational capabilities.

Risk Sharing: PPPs allocate risks between the public and private sectors based on their respective capabilities and areas of expertise. Risks such as construction delays, cost overruns, or revenue fluctuations are distributed to the party best equipped to manage them.

Long-Term Contracts: PPPs involve long-term contracts between the public and private partners. These contracts typically span several years and outline the responsibilities, performance targets, and financial arrangements for the project or service delivery.

Performance-Based Payments: In PPPs, the private sector is often remunerated based on its performance in meeting predefined service levels or delivering specified outcomes. Payments may be linked to performance indicators, availability, user satisfaction, or revenue generated.

Transfer of Assets: PPPs may involve the transfer of assets from the public to the private sector for the duration of the partnership. At the end of the contract term, the assets may be returned to the public sector or transferred to a new private operator.

# Business growth models

Business growth models are frameworks or strategies that organizations employ to drive and sustain their growth over time. Here are some common business growth models.

Organic Growth: Leverage existing resources and capabilities for incremental growth over time, such as to increase sales, upselling, cross-selling, market share, and profitability.

Market Expansion: Enter new markets or segments with existing products or services. This can include targeting new demographics, geographic regions, or industry sectors.

Product Diversification: Introduce new products or services to existing markets. This can be via internal development or acquisitions.

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A): Merge with or acquire other companies to achieve rapid growth and gain access to new markets, technologies, or capabilities, ideally with synergistic effects.

Partnerships and Alliances: Collaborate with organizations to leverage their capabilities, such as via joint ventures, distribution agreements, co-branding, or licensing arrangements.

Franchising: Grant rights to operate under a brand and business model to independent franchisees. This enables rapid expansion by leveraging franchisees while maintaining brand control.

Licensing: Grant others the rights to use intellectual property, such as patents, trademarks, or copyrights, in exchange for royalties or fees.

Digital Transformation: Leverage technology to drive growth and innovation, such as via e-commerce, digitizing operations, implementing data analytics, or developing digital products or services.

Global Expansion: Enter international markets to expand the customer base and tap into new opportunities. It requires understanding cultural differences, regulatory environments, and adapting offerings.

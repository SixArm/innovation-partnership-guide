# Stage-gate

Stage-gate is a project management and product development process that helps organizations efficiently and effectively manage their innovation projects. It is a structured approach that breaks down the innovation process into distinct stages, or gates, with specific criteria for evaluating and approving progress at each stage. The stage-gate process aims to reduce risk, enhance decision-making, and increase the chances of successful project outcomes.

The typical stage-gate process consists of the following key elements:

* Stages: The innovation process is divided into several stages, each representing a critical phase in the project's development. These stages often include idea generation, concept development, prototyping, testing, scaling up, and commercialization. Each stage has specific objectives and deliverables.

* Gates: Between each stage, there are gates or decision points. At these gates, project teams present their work and progress to a cross-functional gatekeeping team or project review board. The gatekeepers assess the project's viability, alignment with strategic goals, risks, and resource requirements before deciding whether to proceed to the next stage.

* Criteria: Each gate has predefined criteria that the project must meet to progress to the next stage. These criteria act as checkpoints to ensure that projects are on track and align with the organization's strategic priorities. The gatekeepers use these criteria to make informed decisions about continuing or stopping the project.

* Review and Approval: During gate reviews, the gatekeeping team evaluates the project's progress, resource allocation, market potential, technical feasibility, and other factors. Based on their assessment, they decide whether to approve the project to move to the next stage, request further development, make modifications, or terminate the project.

* Iterative Process: The stage-gate process is often iterative, allowing for feedback, learning, and adjustments at each stage. If a project does not meet the criteria at a gate, the team may need to revisit the previous stage, make improvements, and reapply for approval at the next gate.

Benefits of the stage-gate process include:

* Improved project selection: The structured approach helps prioritize and select the most promising innovation projects based on their potential value and alignment with strategic objectives.

* Risk reduction: By conducting thorough evaluations at each gate, organizations can identify and address potential risks early in the innovation process, reducing the likelihood of costly failures.

* Resource optimization: The stage-gate process allows organizations to allocate resources more effectively by focusing efforts on projects that have passed gate reviews and show a higher likelihood of success.

* Enhanced decision-making: Clear criteria and gate reviews facilitate data-driven decision-making and provide a mechanism for senior management to stay informed about project progress.

Overall, the stage-gate process is a valuable tool for organizations seeking to manage their innovation projects more strategically, efficiently, and successfully.

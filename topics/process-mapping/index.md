# Process Mapping

Process Mapping is a technique used in business analysis to visually represent the flow of work or processes within an organization. It helps identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and redundancies in processes. It finds ways to improve them. It is often used in conjunction with other business analysis tools and techniques such as workflow diagrams, swimlane diagrams, and value stream maps. The goal is clear view of a process.

**Key steps:**

1. **Identify the process to be mapped:** Conduct interviews with key stakeholders, review documentation, and observe the process in action.

2. **Define the scope of the process:** Sets the boundaries of the process, including the inputs, outputs, and stakeholders involved.

3. **Gather information:** Research the process steps that may be involved, the roles and responsibilities of those involved, and any relevant metrics or data.

4. **Create the process map:** Create a visual representation of the process, typically using a flowchart or diagram. Includes the steps, decision points, and each step's inputs and outputs.

5. **Analyze the process:** Identify areas for improvement. Look for bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or redundancies. Seek ways to streamline the process or eliminate unnecessary steps.

6. **Develop recommendations:** Ideate how to improve the process based on the analysis. Consider new procedures or workflows. Propose changes to existing processes.

7. **Implement recommendations:** Do the changes. Monitor results to ensure the changes have the desired effect.

# Degrees of innovation

Degrees of innovation refers to different levels or categories of innovation based on the magnitude of change or novelty introduced by an innovation. The three commonly recognized degrees of innovation are incremental innovation, breakthrough innovation, and radical innovation.

* Incremental Innovation: Incremental innovation refers to small improvements or enhancements made to existing products, services, processes, or systems. It involves making iterative changes, refining existing features, or optimizing performance. Incremental innovations are typically aimed at increasing efficiency, reducing costs, improving user experience, or addressing minor issues. While incremental innovations may not be disruptive, they contribute to the continuous improvement and evolution of existing offerings.

* Breakthrough Innovation: Breakthrough innovation involves significant advancements or disruptions within a particular industry or domain. It goes beyond incremental improvements and introduces novel approaches, features, or functionalities that create substantial value or address unmet needs. Breakthrough innovations often represent a leap forward, challenging existing norms and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. They have the potential to disrupt markets, create new business models, or revolutionize industries.

* Radical Innovation: Radical innovation represents a complete departure from existing practices, products, or technologies. It involves introducing entirely new concepts, ideas, or paradigms that fundamentally change the way things are done. Radical innovations often disrupt entire industries, displacing existing solutions or creating entirely new markets. They require significant shifts in thinking, entail high risks, and have the potential for significant rewards. Examples of radical innovations include the introduction of personal computers, the advent of the internet, or the emergence of blockchain technology.

It's important to note that the classification of an innovation into a specific degree may vary based on context and industry. What may be considered radical innovation in one industry may be seen as a breakthrough or incremental innovation in another. The degrees of innovation provide a framework to understand and categorize the nature and impact of innovation, helping organizations and researchers analyze the level of novelty and disruption introduced by different innovations.

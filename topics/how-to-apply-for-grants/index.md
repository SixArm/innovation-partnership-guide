# How to apply for grants

Applying for grants involves a structured process that requires careful planning, preparation, and attention to detail.

General steps…

Identify Grants: Research grants for your goals, via government agencies, foundations, corporations, and nonprofits. Consider eligibility, priorities, deadlines, and amounts.

Understand Guidelines: Thoroughly review the grant guidelines, instructions, and requirements. Understand the grant purpose, scope, and the criteria and expectations for applicants.

Gather Documentation: Collect information required for the grant application, such as organizational details, letters of support, résumés, and any other supporting materials.

Write a Proposal: Clearly define your project or program, and create a plan that specifies objectives, activities, timelines, outcomes, impacts, and how these relate to the grant.

Submit the Application: Proofread the proposal. Seek feedback from colleagues and mentors. Iterate. Then submit your grant application by the specified deadline.

Follow Up: Follow up with the grant-giving organization to confirm receipt of your application and inquire about the selection timeline or any additional steps in the review process.

# Joint venture (JV)

A joint venture (JV) is a business arrangement in which two or more independent entities come together to form a new entity or partnership to pursue a specific business objective. In a joint venture, the participating entities contribute resources, expertise, and capital to the newly formed entity and share in its risks, rewards, and control.

**Key aspects**:

Shared Ownership: Joint ventures involve shared ownership between two or more entities. Each entity typically holds a percentage of ownership in the new venture.

Common Objective: Joint ventures are formed to pursue a specific business objective or project, such as entering a new market, developing a new product, or achieving mutual benefits.

Shared Risk and Reward: Participants share investment costs, operational expenses, and potential profits or losses, typically in proportion to their ownership stake.

Separate Legal Entity: A joint venture is usually established as a separate legal entity, such as a partnership or a corporation. This entity operates independently with its own set of agreements.

Limited Duration: Joint ventures are often established for a specific period or purpose. The duration of a joint venture can range from a short-term project to a long-term program partnership.

Access to Resources: Participants can leverage each other's resources, expertise, and market knowledge, enabling them to achieve goals that may have been difficult to accomplish individually.

Knowledge Transfer: Participants can share skills, training, best practices, and potentially intellectual property, leading to mutual learning and innovation.

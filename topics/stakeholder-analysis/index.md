# Stakeholder analysis

Stakeholder analysis is a process of identifying and analyzing the various groups or individuals who have an interest in a particular project or organization. The goal is to understand the needs, expectations, interests, and influence of each stakeholder, in order to effectively manage relationships.

Stakeholders can be internal or external to the organization, and can include individuals or groups such as employees, customers, suppliers, investors, government agencies, NGOs, and the media.

**Key steps:**

1. **Identify stakeholders:** Create a list of groups and people who may be affected by the project or organization.

2. **Prioritize stakeholders:** Rank them based on their level of interest, power, and influence.

3. **Assess interests:** Gather information about each stakeholder's needs, expectations, and concerns. This information can be collected through surveys, interviews, or focus groups.

4. **Analyze influence:** Consider each stakeholder's potential impact on the project or organization.

5. **Develop stakeholder management:** Initiate communication plans, engagement activities, and conflict resolution strategies.

Benefits of stakeholder analysis include better stakeholder relationships, improved communication, better decision-making, and risk mitigation.

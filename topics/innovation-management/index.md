# Innovation management

Innovation management refers to the processes, strategies, and activities that organizations employ to foster and control innovation within their operations. It involves the entire lifecycle from generating ideas to commercializing solutions. It requires organizational support, leadership, cross-functional collaboration, and calculated risk.

Idea Generation: Create a culture and system that encourages ideas. Consider brainstorming sessions, idea contests, suggestion programs, and collaborations with partners.

Idea Selection: Decide which ideas have the most potential. Use criteria such as feasibility, market potential, alignment with organizational goals, and resource requirements.

Resource Allocation: Provide the necessary resources to proceed, such as funding, time, talent, training, partnerships, and materials.

Innovation Development: Transform ideas into tangible innovations, via prototyping, testing, and iterative development, to ensure the idea meets user needs and aligns with organizational objectives.

Innovation Implementation: Integrate the innovations into the organization's operations. This may involve changes to processes, systems, and structures to ensure effective delivery.

Evaluation: Monitor the progress of innovations, measure their impact, and identify areas for improvement. Identify successful innovations, learn from failures, and make data-driven decisions.

Intellectual Property Protection: Apply for patents, trademarks, or copyrights, or categorize trade secrets, to gain a competitive advantage.

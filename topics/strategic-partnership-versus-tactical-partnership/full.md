# Strategic partnership versus tactical partnership

Strategic Partnership and Tactical Partnership are two distinct types of partnerships, each serving different purposes and objectives. Here's a comparison between the two:

Strategic Partnership: A strategic partnership is a long-term collaborative alliance between two or more organizations that align their goals, resources, and capabilities to achieve mutual benefits. Key characteristics of a strategic partnership include:

* Shared Vision and Objectives: Strategic partners have a common understanding of their long-term vision and strategic goals. They collaborate to achieve outcomes that go beyond immediate or short-term gains.

* Complementary Capabilities: Strategic partners bring different but complementary strengths, expertise, and resources to the partnership. By combining their capabilities, they create synergy and achieve outcomes that neither partner could accomplish alone.

* Long-Term Commitment: Strategic partnerships are typically formed for an extended period, often spanning multiple years. The partners invest time, effort, and resources in building and nurturing the partnership to achieve sustained growth and competitive advantage.

* Deeper Collaboration: Strategic partners engage in deep collaboration, sharing information, knowledge, and resources. They may undertake joint research and development, co-create products or services, or jointly explore new markets.

* Risk and Reward Sharing: Strategic partners share risks and rewards associated with the partnership. They may invest in joint ventures, revenue-sharing models, or equity arrangements to align incentives and drive mutual success.

* Joint Decision-Making: Strategic partners collaborate in making important decisions that impact the partnership's direction, investments, and strategic priorities. This requires open communication, trust, and a commitment to consensus-building.

Tactical Partnership: A tactical partnership, also known as a transactional partnership, is a shorter-term collaboration between organizations that focuses on achieving specific, immediate objectives. Key characteristics of a tactical partnership include:

* Specific Objectives: Tactical partners collaborate to achieve specific, short-term goals or address immediate needs. The partnership's scope and duration are often limited to achieving those defined objectives.

* Task-Oriented Collaboration: Tactical partnerships are focused on completing specific tasks or projects. Partners work together to achieve a specific outcome without necessarily aligning their long-term strategies or broader goals.

* Limited Resource Sharing: Tactical partners may share certain resources or expertise required to accomplish the specific objectives of the partnership. However, the sharing of resources is often limited in scope and duration.

* Flexibility and Adaptability: Tactical partnerships are more flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances. They can be formed or dissolved relatively quickly based on the specific project or goal at hand.

* Operational Decision-Making: Tactical partners make decisions related to project execution and delivery, typically within their respective areas of responsibility. The decision-making process is more focused on achieving short-term results.

* Limited Risk and Reward Sharing: Tactical partners generally bear their own risks and rewards associated with the specific project or objective. There is usually no long-term commitment to sharing risks and rewards beyond the immediate collaboration.

It's important to note that strategic partnerships and tactical partnerships are not mutually exclusive. In some cases, organizations may start with tactical partnerships to achieve immediate goals and then transition them into long-term strategic partnerships based on mutual success and alignment. The choice between strategic and tactical partnerships depends on the specific objectives, resources, and time horizons of the organizations involved.

# Strategic partnership versus tactical partnership

Strategic partnership and tactical partnership are two distinct types of partnerships, each serving different purposes and objectives. A strategic partnership is a longer-term collaborative alliance between two or more organizations that align their goals, resources, and capabilities to achieve mutual benefits. A tactical partnership, also known as a transactional partnership, is a shorter-term collaboration between organizations that focuses on achieving specific, immediate objectives.

Strategic partnership characteristics: collaboration toward a shared long-term vision, including complementary objectives and strengths; deep collaboration and resource sharing; deep relationship building over time; generally higher levels of risk-sharing and reward-sharing; long-term commitment.

Tactical partnership characteristics: collaboration to achieve specific short-term goals or address immediate needs; limited collaboration and resource sharing; can be formed or dissolved relatively quickly; oriented toward execution; generally lower risk and reward; no long-term commitment.

Strategic partnerships and tactical partnerships are not mutually exclusive. In some cases, organizations may start with tactical partnerships to achieve immediate goals and then transition them into long-term strategic partnerships based on mutual success and alignment. The choice between strategic and tactical partnerships depends on the specific objectives, resources, and time horizons of the organizations involved.

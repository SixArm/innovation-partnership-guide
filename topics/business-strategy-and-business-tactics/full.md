# Business strategy and business tactics

Business strategy refers to the overall plan and direction set by an organization to achieve its long-term goals. It involves making key decisions about the organization's mission, vision, values, target market, competitive positioning, and value proposition. Business strategy focuses on answering fundamental questions such as what business the company is in, how it will differentiate itself from competitors, and how it will create value for its customers. Strategies are typically formulated at the higher levels of an organization and provide guidance for decision-making across the entire enterprise.

Business tactics are the specific actions, initiatives, and methods employed to execute the broader business strategy. They are the practical steps taken to achieve short-term objectives and goals within the framework of the overall strategy. Tactics are more operational and detailed in nature, involving specific activities, resource allocation, and implementation plans. They are responsive to the immediate circumstances and are designed to optimize performance in various functional areas such as marketing, sales, operations, finance, and human resources. Tactics are focused on the day-to-day activities that support the strategic goals of the organization.

To illustrate the difference, consider an example in the context of launching a new product:

* The business strategy may involve decisions about target market identification, competitive positioning, and differentiation. It may include considerations like entering new markets, diversifying product offerings, or focusing on specific customer segments.

* The business tactics may involve specific actions such as market research, product development, pricing strategies, distribution channel selection, promotional campaigns, and sales tactics. These tactics are executed to support the overall strategy of successfully launching and marketing the new product.

In summary, business strategy sets the long-term direction and goals of an organization, while business tactics are the specific actions taken to execute the strategy and achieve short-term objectives. Strategy focuses on the "what" and "why," while tactics focus on the "how" and "when." Both strategy and tactics are essential components in achieving business success, with strategy providing the overarching guidance and tactics providing the practical means to implement the strategy effectively.

# Ability, capability, capacity

Ability, capability, and capacity are related terms that refer to different aspects of an individual or an organization's potential or competence. While they are often used interchangeably, there are subtle distinctions between them. Notably, abilities and capabilities contribute to an entity's capacity, which represents the maximum limit or potential for performance in a timeframe.

* **Ability**: Refers to inherent or acquired skill or talent to perform a specific task or activity. It is the proficiency or aptitude to do something. Abilities are individual attributes and can be natural or developed through learning and practice. For example, someone may have the ability to communicate effectively, problem-solve, or perform a specific technical task.

* **Capability**: This encompasses a broader range of skills, knowledge, and resources that enable an individual or organization to perform tasks or achieve specific outcomes. It reflects the capacity to apply abilities effectively in various contexts. Capabilities involve a combination of skills, expertise, experience, resources, tools, and processes. For example, an organization may have the capability to deliver complex projects, develop innovative products, or provide excellent customer service.

* **Capacity**: Refers to the overall potential or available resources to perform tasks or handle workloads. It relates to the quantity or volume of work that can be accomplished within a given timeframe. Capacity is influenced by factors such as available workforce, infrastructure, financial resources, and operational efficiency. It represents the maximum level of output or workload that can be managed effectively. For example, a manufacturing plant may have a production capacity of a certain number of units per day.

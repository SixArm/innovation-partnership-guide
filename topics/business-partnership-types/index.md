# Business partnership types

Business partnerships can take various forms, each with its own characteristics and legal structures. Here are some common types.

Consortium: A formal agreement among legally-independent partners to undertake a specific project or pursue a common goal.

Alliance: Partners pursue mutually-beneficial goals without a formal agreement. Alliances are flexible and do not need a new legal entity.

General Partnership: Partners join together to run a business, and share equal responsibility, liability, and decision-making authority.

Joint Venture (JV): Partners contribute resources, expertise, or capital to pursue a common objective, such as a specific project or plan.

Equity Partnership: Partners share ownership in a business entity, such as via shares, and participate in decision-making and profits in proportion to ownership.

Co-operative Partnership: Co-operatives operate on the principle of democratic control, with members having an equal say in decision-making and sharing in the benefits or profits.

Limited Partnership: General partners are active in management and have unlimited liability, while limited partners are passive in management and have limited liability.

Limited Liability Partnership (LLP): Partners have limited personal liability for the partnership's debts and obligations. LLPs are commonly used by professional service firms.

Franchise: The owner of a business concept grants a franchisee the right to operate using the owner's brand and systems, in exchange for fees or royalties.

Supplier/Reseller: The supplier provides products or services to the reseller, who sells them to end customers. This may involve distribution agreements, supply contracts, or joint marketing.

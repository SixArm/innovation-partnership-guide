## Why am I creating this?

I am creating this ebook because of years of experience in innovation partnership work, with a wide range of clients, from small startups to enormous enterprises.


### For team collaboration

When I work with companies and teams, then I'm able to use glossaries like this one to help create shared context and clearer communication. This can accelerate working together, and can help teams forge better innovation partnerships, in my direct experience.

For example, one of my enterprise clients describes this kind of shared context and clear communication in a positive sense as "singing from the same songbook". When a team understands innovation partnership terminology, and has a quick easy glossary for definitions and explanations, then it's akin to teammates with the same songbook.


### For cross-cultural communication

What I discovered is that these kinds of glossaries can be especially helpful for teams with members coming from various cultures, such as from different countries, or different industries, or different ways of working. The topic pages help provide a baseline for better collaboration.
